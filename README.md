##Asynchronous Javascript

# Engineering Problems

This problem contains three functions which return promises.
It tests your understanding of ASYNCHRONOUS JavaScript.

You can run the test cases by running

```bash
yarn
yarn jest --watch
```

Or if you use npm

```bash
npm install
npm test -- --watch
```

You can add more test cases by adding to the tests folder

The initial problems can be found in Question-1.md and Question-2.md
The solution to question-1.md should go in `src/analysis.js`
The solution to question-2.md should go in `src/report.js`


---
Do not delete the `node_modules` folder in the `src` folder, it is a hack to get the `api` files to be absolute.

See documentation for the `api` module at [api.md](./api.md)
